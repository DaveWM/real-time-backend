# real-time-backend

A Leiningen template for the backend of a real-time app.
Designed to be used with the [real-time-frontend template](https://github.com/DaveWM/real-time-frontend).


## Usage

Create a new project with `lein new real-time-backend <app-name>`.

To run locally, you need the `datomic-pro` dependency from a private repo. Sign up [here](https://www.datomic.com/get-datomic.html), and then follow the Leiningen setup instructions.
After you've done this, just run `lein run` to start the app.
